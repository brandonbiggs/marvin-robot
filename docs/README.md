# Marvin: The Lego MindStorm Robot Wrapper
This is an incredibly simplified wrapper for the 
Lego Mindstorm ev3dev project. The purpose of this wrapper is 
to help beginning programmers understand syntax of programming 
while also applying it to something physical that they can play 
with using the Mindstorm robots. 

Currently applicable to all Mindstorms that are using the ev3dev linux 
operating system, but only has features for the Ev3rstorm and Gripp3r 
Mindstorms, which we call Optimus and Marvin respectively.
