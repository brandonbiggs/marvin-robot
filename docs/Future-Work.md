## TODO - Tasks that I'm still working on
- Get turning working for specific degree rotations based on user input
- Figure out how to connect via bluetooth or wifi
- Marvin junior still needs ample work ensuring it matches up with Marvin, but priority right now is marvin Sr.
- Figure out shoot-ball functionality
- Figure out sensor functionality
- Dream goal: implement some kind of AI algorithm to look around. Unsupervised learning.
- Add some notes about more easily working with visual studio code such as code runner extension and autosave.

## Current Bugs
- Turning and moving are still not perfect. I've got a fix in the works for these however.
