## Helpful Resources
* You may find many different tutorials out there. The only thing that we change from most tutorials is that we use a custom Python programming wrapper to make programming the Lego Mindstorms much easier. Experienced programmers should be able to use any code tutorials out there, we just recommend ours to help even the most inexperienced programmers.

* List of all available commands that can be ran using our wrapper can be found on the Github readme page
